I've been trying to get my personal website running for a very long time. One of the biggest things for me was the fact that I wanted everything to be perfect, and.... well I could never get around to making things as perfect as i wanted to be.

Recently I've been working hard at the #100DaysOfCode Challenge in a bid to challenge that habit of mine. Done is better than perfect because I'll always find some problem that will piss me off when it comes to my website. So, with that in mind, I finally finished v0.02 of my blog. 

Here's the main reasons behind my naming convention, which I'll follow standard NPM package naming - to the best of my knowledge at least.

1. 0 : It starts with a 0 instead of a 1 because a large chunk of the blog is still unfinished as of this date. There needs to be a contact form, a podcast section and a projects section. Once that is done I'll upgrade the versioning to a V1 instead of a V0
2. 0.02 : Its a very small step, but this reflects my step up from starting a Next JS template to getting it integrated with Tailwind CSS and dynamically generating routes for my blog posts. 

With that in mind, here's my coding for the #100DaysOfCode challenge which I've embarked upon.

Now that we've got the admin stuff out of the way, I think it'll be useful to get my coding plan in the shots. This plan is what I have in mind for preparing for the round of technical interviews. 

### Weaknesses

Some of my main weaknesses that I've found have been

1.  A Lack of familiarity with general data structures
2.   A lack of exposure to variations of conventional data structures.
3.   Slow Coding speed
